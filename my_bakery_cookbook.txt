--- Flapper Pie ---
Ingredients:
- 1 1/2 cups Graham Cracker Crumbs
- 6 tablespoons Melted Butter
- 1/2 cup Sugar
- 1/2 tsp Ground Cinnamon
- 2 1/2 cups Milk
- 1/2 cup Sugar
- 1/4 cup Cornstarch
- 3 Egg Yolks
- 1 tsp Vanilla Extract
- 1/4 tsp Salt
- 3 Egg White
- 1/4 cup Sugar
- 1/4 tsp Cream Of Tartar

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350˚F.
Mix all the crust ingredients (graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, granulated sugar and ground cinnamon) in a medium bowl. Set aside about 2 Tbsp (30 mL) for later and press the mixture into a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate in the bottom and up the sides. Bake crust for 10 minutes, it will only brown slightly.
Combine the vanilla custard filling ingredients (milk, granulated sugar, cornstarch, egg yolks, vanilla extract and salt together) and cook on medium heat, stirring constantly, until it bubbles and thickens to the texture of pudding. Set aside to cool while you make the meringue topping.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the beater attachment or in a large bowl using an electric mixer beat the meringue ingredients (egg whites, granulated sugar, cream of tartar) together until it holds stiff and glossy peaks.
To assemble the pie, pour the filling into the crust and top with a thick layer of the meringue, making little spikes that will brown on top. Sprinkle the reserved crumb over the top and place it into the preheated oven.
Bake until the meringue browns, around 10 minutes, making sure to watch it carefully.
Chill in the fridge and eat within a few hours of baking. This pie is best eaten the same day as the meringue will soften and liquify.

--- Classic Christmas pudding ---
Ingredients:
- 50g Almonds
- 2 large Bramley Apples
- 200g Candied Peel
- 1 whole Nutmeg
- 1kg Raisins
- 140g Plain Flour
- 100g Breadcrumbs
- 100g Muscovado Sugar
- 3 Large Eggs
- 2 tbs Brandy
- 250g Butter

Instructions:
Get everything for the pudding prepared. Chop the almonds coarsely. Peel, core and chop the cooking apples. Sharpen your knife and chop the candied peel. (You can chop the almonds and apples in a food processor, but the peel must be done by hand.) Grate three quarters of the nutmeg (sounds a lot but it's correct).

Mix the almonds, apples, candied peel, nutmeg, raisins, flour, breadcrumbs, light muscovado sugar, eggs and 2 tbsp brandy or cognac in a large bowl.

Holding the butter in its wrapper, grate a quarter of it into the bowl, then stir everything together. Repeat until all the butter is grated, then stir for 3-4 mins – the mixture is ready when it subsides slightly after each stir. Ask the family to stir too, and get everyone to make a wish.

Generously butter two 1.2 litre bowls and put a circle of baking parchment in the bottom of each. Pack in the pudding mixture. Cover with a double layer of baking parchment, pleating it to allow for expansion, then tie with string (keep the paper in place with a rubber band while tying). Trim off any excess paper.

Now stand each bowl on a large sheet of foil and bring the edges up over the top, then put another sheet of foil over the top and bring it down underneath to make a double package (this makes the puddings watertight). Tie with more string, and make a handle for easy lifting in and out of the pan. Watch our video to see how to tie up a pudding correctly.

Boil or oven steam the puddings for 8 hrs, topping up with water as necessary. Remove from the pans and leave to cool overnight. When cold, discard the messy wrappings and re-wrap in new baking parchment, foil and string. Store in a cool, dry place until Christmas.

To make the brandy butter, cream the butter with the orange zest and icing sugar. Gradually beat in the brandy or cognac and chopped stem ginger. Put in a small bowl, fork the top attractively and put in the fridge to set. The butter will keep for a week in the fridge, or it can be frozen for up to six weeks.

On Christmas Day, boil or oven steam for 1 hr. Unwrap and turn out. To flame, warm 3-4 tbsp brandy in a small pan, pour it over the pudding and set light to it.

--- New York cheesecake ---
Ingredients:
- 85g Butter
- 140g Sour Cream
- 1tbsp Sugar
- 900g Cream Cheese
- 250g Caster Sugar
- 3 tbs Plain Flour
- 1 ½ teaspoons Lemon Juice
- 3 Large Eggs
- 250ml Sour Cream
- 150ml Sour Cream
- 1 tbsp Caster Sugar
- 2 tsp Lemon Juice

Instructions:
Position an oven shelf in the middle of the oven. Preheat the oven to fan 160C/conventional 180C/gas 4. Line the base of a 23cm springform cake tin with parchment paper. For the crust, melt the butter in a medium pan. Stir in the biscuit crumbs and sugar so the mixture is evenly moistened. Press the mixture into the bottom of the pan and bake for 10 minutes. Cool on a wire rack while preparing the filling.
For the filling, increase the oven temperature to fan 200C/conventional 240C/gas 9. In a table top mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the soft cheese at medium-low speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. With the mixer on low, gradually add the sugar, then the flour and a pinch of salt, scraping down the sides of the bowl and the paddle twice.
Swap the paddle attachment for the whisk. Continue by adding the vanilla, lemon zest and juice. Whisk in the eggs and yolk, one at a time, scraping the bowl and whisk at least twice. Stir the 284ml carton of soured cream until smooth, then measure 200ml/7fl oz (just over 3⁄4 of the carton). Continue on low speed as you add the measured soured cream (reserve the rest). Whisk to blend, but don't over-beat. The batter should be smooth, light and somewhat airy.
Brush the sides of the springform tin with melted butter and put on a baking sheet. Pour in the filling - if there are any lumps, sink them using a knife - the top should be as smooth as possible. Bake for 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to fan 90C/conventional 110C/gas 1⁄4 and bake for 25 minutes more. If you gently shake the tin, the filling should have a slight wobble. Turn off the oven and open the oven door for a cheesecake that's creamy in the centre, or leave it closed if you prefer a drier texture. Let cool in the oven for 2 hours. The cheesecake may get a slight crack on top as it cools.
Combine the reserved soured cream with the 142ml carton, the sugar and lemon juice for the topping. Spread over the cheesecake right to the edges. Cover loosely with foil and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or overnight.
Run a round-bladed knife around the sides of the tin to loosen any stuck edges. Unlock the side, slide the cheesecake off the bottom of the tin onto a plate, then slide the parchment paper out from underneath.
